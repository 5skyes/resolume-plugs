# 5skyes-resolume-plugs
A collection of resolume plugins all under the MIT License. Many are wire plugs, which should be editable. If we've uploaded a non-editable version (.cwired), open an issue.

To install these with presets, drop the folder for the effect you want in C:\Users\<USER>\Documents\Resolume Wire\Patches and Arena should automagically see them.
